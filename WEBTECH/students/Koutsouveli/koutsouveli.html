              <div class="post-copy">
                  I have been enjoying music, starting from the young age of 5. That is when i started playing the piano!.
                  I was part of the school's choir and i did take singing classes for a few years. Also took music theory classes and passed multiple classes.

              <div class="post-copy">
                  Some people would say i go crazy for concerts. And who am i to disagree?! My first concert was when i was really young at around 6 years old!
                  Nowadays i do not miss a chance to attend any concerts of my favourite artists!

              <div class="post-copy">
                  Starting from a really young age, i have always been really into technology. I was always curious about new phones and devices coming out each year.
                  My love for coding grew during high school when i took a compolsury coding class! I realized i can combine both creativity and technology.
                  I.T is a field that will continue to grow and there will always be new things to discover and try out.
