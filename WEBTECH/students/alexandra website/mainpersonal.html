                My name is Alexandra Papafragkou. I am a student at Atch Tech with a passion for computer science but not just that.
                Ever since I can remember, I could not limit myself to one choice, to one hobby.

                Computing science became my passion once I realised what I am able to create with it. My creativity can be limitless inside 
                this endless world of binary numbers. <br>
                <br>
                As an individual, I believe travelling is required for an individuals growth. Therefore I enjoy travelling, and I do travel often.
                This profession, computer science, allows me to work remotely, from wherever in the world I please.<br>
                <br>
                Therefore, it allows me to expand my horizons and never run out of inspiration, while coming up with new creative ideas.<br>
                After all, changing out enviroment is key to remaining productive.<br>
                <br>
                The combinition of unlimited "space" to create and being able to create anything from nothing, along with the ability
                to travel to prevent burn-out, really drew me to this profession.<br>
                <br>
                That aside, coding is one of the most enjoyable things I have found myself commiting to.<br>
                No matter how tough and frustrating some codes might get to create, I enjoy the whole process.<br>
                Concluding, I believe this is the most creative profession one can have and I absolutely love it.

                This is my dog. Her name for short, is Spar. Her full name is Sparklips. She is a female maltese dog and she 
                is the nicest, most well behaved small dog I have ever known.<br>
                I believe training dogs shouldn't vary depending on their size, so she is very well trained and well behaved.<br>
                She is the honorable mention of the day since for years now, she has been my most loyal companion.<br>
